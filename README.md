#  PhotoChallenge 

## Udacity you decide project

This App generates a random Photo Challenges. Keywords you should find and take a picture of. 

### Initial Screen 
The inital screen is an overview of all Photo Challenges in a table view. You can add as many challenges as you like. 

### Oxford API
Upon creating an new challenge the app hits the oxford API. It uses the oxford Dictionaries API to let you choose a Domain, subject area of a word. Curently only in english. It than picks a random word out of the domain which represents the challenge. 
Not fully happy with the words the API provides. Perhaps in future I develop an own api that returns predefined keywords tailored to photo taking. ðŸ˜€

### Challenge Detail View
In the challenge detail view you can add as many Photos, either from camera or photo roll, that you think fits the challenge keyword.
